# KKFileManager
A low resource gtk2/3 based, easily customized file manager.

This is still very early days and there is lots to do.<br>
It's very simply functional at the moment, use is:<br>
kkfilemanager /path/to/folder<br>

To build run:<br>
./autogen.s --prefix=/usr<br>
make<br>
NOT recommended yet:<br>
sudo make install<br>

Although the application is installable it is still in it's infancy so best is to runit from the KKFileManager/app folder.<br>
